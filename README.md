# Pathways Assessment Reporting Tool

!> *This documentation is accurate as of October 23, 2024*.

## Summary

The **Pathways Assessment Reporting Tool** is a Canvas-based application for preparing your course to report student performance on Pathways student learning outcomes.

## Project Goals

- Reduce semester-end reporting burden on faculty
- Increase completed reporting submission rate

## Requirements and Assumptions

- Course must use Canvas for assignments and grading
  - Course does not *need* to be publicly available to students
- Pathways concepts and outcomes are pre-loaded in courses in Canvas so you'll only see those that apply to your course

- Faculty then apply outcomes to assignments using the tool

- Assessed assignments must use ***built-in*** Canvas tools

  :white_check_mark: Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, External LTI tools that address a ***single*** Pathways outcome  
  :no_entry_sign: External LTI tools through which multiple Pathways outcomes are evaluated
- Assessed assignments must be configured in the app prior to reporting
  - Can be done at any time during the semester
  - Can be done retroactively even if assignment is in the past

## Outcome Mapping Options
 
Below are the options available for mapping an assignment to an outcome. They will be described in greater detail on subsequent pages.

1. "Thresholds Based on Point Totals"
    - Based on final point total of entire assignment/quiz
    - An overall assignment grade may only be used to measure a Pathways Outcome if every aspect of the assignment directly relates to that outcome and no other Pathways outcomes/skills/knowledge areas.
2. "New Quiz Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz Questions"
    - Based on Pathways outcomes applied to quiz questions
    - Based on number of points on questions for an outcome (at least 3 per outcome per quiz)
    - Quiz must be built with corresponding outcomes
3. "Rubrics with Pathways Outcomes"
    - Add Pathways outcomes to an assignment's rubric
    - Outcomes will be visible to students
4. "Hiding Assessment from Students for a Single Pathways Outcome"
    - Students won't see ratings for Pathways Outcomes in the gradebook.
    - With this method, the same assignment can be used to assess multiple Pathways Outcomes.
    - Requires separate grading in a specialized tool. Course grading and Pathways assessment are separate processes.

## Caveats for Evaluating Quizzes

Canvas has two types of quizzes available: ***Classic*** and ***New***. Unless you have actively created a ***New*** quiz, your quizzes are ***Classic***.

- If you want to evaluate all questions on a quiz for a single Pathways outcome, you can use Option #1 above with ***Classic*** quizzes.
- If you want to evaluate multiple Pathways outcomes in a single quiz, then you MUST use Option #2 above with ***New*** quizzes.

!> **Before you create a New quiz or convert a Classic quiz to a New quiz, please be aware of the following:**  
 :x: You cannot transfer multiple question banks from Classic to New Quizzes  
 :x: New quizzes will not work if you have multiple questions with attachments, files, images, or videos including links to Kaltura videos and 3rd party tools  
 :x: New quizzes cannot function if you use a quiz to act like a survey
