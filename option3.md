# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #3

> **"Rubrics with Pathways Outcomes"**

?> :white_check_mark: Add Pathways outcomes to an assignment's rubric  
:white_check_mark: With this method, the same assignment can be used to assess multiple Pathways Outcomes  
:white_check_mark: Outcomes will be visible to students

Option #3 allows you to create or add to a Canvas rubric for an assignment that includes Pathways outcomes.  When grading the assignment, you will apply the Pathways assessment levels (Developing Competency, Competent, Advanced Competency) to the outcomes in the rubric. Configuring the assignment in the Pathways Assessment Tool links the assignment to the outcome with no further actions necessary.

> Students *will* see the Pathways assessment rubric outcomes when they view the details of your grading. If you do not want this, consider using [Option #4](option4.md) instead.

## Setting up a Rubric

!> The details of using rubrics in Canvas is beyond the scope of this document. Please review TLOS's and Instructure's documentation for [adding and grading with rubrics](https://4help.vt.edu/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=c3f4df0a875fced0dd17426acebb35c7#UseRubrics).

In a new rubric, click the **Find Outcome** link at the bottom of the rubric.

![Find rubric link](/_media/findrubric.png "Find rubric link")

In the "Find Outcomes" pop-up, select **Pathways Assessment** and then the Pathways concept under which your desired outcome is located. 

![Rubric outcome selection step 1](/_media/rubricoutcome1.png "Rubric outcome selection step 1")

Select the outcome from the list.  Uncheck the box for "Use this criterion for scoring".  Click the **Import** button.  Repeat this process for each outcome that can be evaluated in this assignment.

When grading using SpeedGrader, ensure that you choose one of the Pathways levels in the rubric for each student.

## Selecting an Assignment

The select assignment page displays a list of assignments that are valid for Option #3.  If an assignment is available it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:  If it has already been configured for another outcome under Option #1 ("Thresholds Based on Point Totals"), the button will be greyed out and marked as **"Unavailable"**. :two:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments eligible, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :three:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :four:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :five: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students), unpublished (unavailable to students), or already configured for another outcome. :six:

To help you match an assignment to the outcome you're currently working on, the list of assignments also displays a list of Pathways outcomes that have been added to an assignment's rubric. :seven: If there are no outcomes associated with the assignment you want to use, you can click on the name of the assignment to add them now. You may only select one assignment per Pathways learning outcome.

If one assignment addresses multiple Pathways learning outcomes, Option #3 allows the same assignment to be used to measure more than one Pathways outcome.

## Confirming the Configuration

### Assignment Has an Outcome Configured

If an assignment has a rubric with the current outcome associated with it, you will see the following message:

![Assignment Rubric Ready](/_media/assignmentrubricready.png "Assignment Rubric Ready")

Click the **Confirm and Save** button then click anywhere on the screen when the confirmation box appears.

### Assignment Does NOT Have an Outcome Configured

If an assignment does **NOT** have a rubric with the current outcome associated with it:

![Assignment Rubric Not Ready](/_media/assignmentrubricnotready.png "Assignment Rubric Not Ready")

Here, the **Confirm and Save** button is deactivated, and the message reflects that the assignment is not properly set up.

From this screen, you can click on the name of the assignment to open it in a new browser tab.  Then you will be able to add the outcome to a rubric [as demonstrated above](#setting-up-a-rubric).

After you have added the outcome to a rubric, return to this page and click the **refresh** link in the message. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the message from the **Assignment Has an Outcome Configured** section above.

## Finalizing Option #3

!> ***IMPORTANT NOTE***  
Your assignment must already have been completed by students, **AND** you must grade the assignment before continuing.

From the Dashboard screen, click the **Finalize Outcomes** button next to the assignment configured with Option #3.

![Begin finalizing option 3](/_media/finalizeoption3.png "Begin finalizing option 3")

Double-check that the distribution of scores matches your perceptions of the quality of student work submitted. If students have not completed the assignment or you have not graded those students' assignments, they will be categorized under "No Evidence".

![Confirming option 3 setup](/_media/confirmoption3.png "Confirming option 3 setup")

If the data are correct, click the **Confirm & Submit** button then click anywhere on the screen to return to the dashboard.

The assignment will then appear as **Complete**.  If you have completed this process too soon (e.g., more assignments need to be graded, accidentally clicked Confirm, etc.), click the **Undo Finalization** button.
