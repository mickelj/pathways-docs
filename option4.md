# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #4

> **"Assess an Assignment Separately from Grading Without Modifying Existing Rubrics or Showing Pathways Rubrics to Students"**

?> :white_check_mark: Creates a copy of all students' submissions for an assignment  
:white_check_mark: Hides Pathways outcomes from students  
:white_check_mark: Discussions and Quizzes cannot be copied  
:white_check_mark: Requires re-grading using a Pathways rubric

Outcome #4 creates a copy of all students' submissions for an assignment so that you can grade without students seeing the Pathways ratings. 

You will first grade your students normally and then use the Pathways Assessment Tool to make the copy.  You will then rate students using a Pathways rubric on the copied assignment.
