# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #4

> **"Assess an Assignment Separately from Grading Without Modifying Existing Rubrics or Showing Pathways Rubrics to Students"**

?> :white_check_mark: Creates a copy of all students' submissions for an assignment  
:white_check_mark: Hides Pathways outcomes from students  
:white_check_mark: Discussions and Quizzes cannot be copied  
:white_check_mark: Requires re-grading using a Pathways rubric

Outcome #4 creates a copy of all students' submissions for an assignment so that you can grade without students seeing the Pathways ratings. 

You will first grade your students normally and then use the Pathways Assessment Tool to make the copy.  You will then rate students using a Pathways rubric on the copied assignment.

## Selecting an Assignment

The select assignment page displays a list of assignments that are valid for Option #4.  If an assignment is available it will have a green **"Select"** button to its right. :one:  If it has already been configured for another outcome, the button will be greyed out and marked as **"Unavailable"**. :two:

If you have more than ten (10) assignments eligible, then the assignments will be broken into multiple pages that can be scrolled through at the bottom of the list. :three:

Clicking the name of an assignment will open that Canvas assignment in a new browser tab. :four:

In the list, you are reminded of the points that each assignment is worth :five: and the state of the assignment in Canvas: published (available to students), unpublished (unavailable to students), or already configured for another outcome. :six:

## Creating a Copy
