# Configuring Outcome Mapping Option #2

> **"New Quiz Thresholds Based on Selected Quiz Questions"**

?> :white_check_mark: Based on Pathways outcomes applied to quiz questions  
:white_check_mark: Based on number of questions with credit/no credit (at least 3 per outcome per quiz)  
:white_check_mark: Quiz must be built with corresponding outcomes

Option #2 is used if you want to assess a quiz using ***multiple*** Pathways learning outcomes.  If you are only assessing a ***single*** outcome for an entire quiz, please consider using Option #1 instead.

To use Option #2, your quiz must have been created using **New Quizzes** in Canvas. If you have not consciously chosen "New Quiz" when creating a quiz, then your quiz is a **Classic** quiz.

!> Creating a New Quiz is beyond the scope of this document. First, please review [TLOS's information regarding how New Quizzes may impact your course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9UzmXJjRu_THnXA6l759l9qiaO8AOLDi_nD6y9u6fY/edit#heading=h.424hqqt677wu). Before creating a New Quiz, you will need to follow that document's instructions for turning on New Quizzes in your course site.  
For further help, see ["How do I create a quiz using New Quizzes"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-quiz-using-New-Quizzes/ta-p/1173) from the Canvas community site or contact TLOS.   
You can also convert a Classic quiz to a New quiz by [following these instructions from Stanford](https://canvashelp.stanford.edu/hc/en-us/articles/4405026108179-Enable-and-Use-New-Quizzes#h_01HPJ2MZZSH23BTJDDXYYXY5G7).  You will receive an email when the conversion is complete.
