# Frequently Asked Questions

## What do I do if I am assessing paper assignments (or a performance or another piece of student work that is not submitted electronically in Canvas)?

## How can I use student work that utilizes third-party software such as ALEKS, Cengage, MyLab, etc.? 

## What if I don’t want my students to see how they are rated on the Pathways student learning outcomes approved for my course?

## How can I make sure that student ratings on Pathways student learning outcomes are not part of students’ course grades?

## I currently use Classic Quizzes but would like to use Option #2 for Pathways assessment. Should I make the switch to New Quizzes? If so, what do I need to do?

## If I want to use Option #4, what type of assignments can I use?

## What if I am teaching multiple sections of the same course this semester but only one section has been sampled for Pathways assessment?

## If I am the course coordinator for a large, multi-section Pathways course, can I configure the Pathways Assessment Tool for the sampled sections taught by my GAs so that they can just do the grading/rating? How do I do this?

## What if I have already graded/rated student work for Pathways assessment and then a student submits late work?
